This plugin allows you to exclude posts that belong to certain categories from your home page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to **exclude** posts that belong to certain categories from your **home page**, while they will still be reachable
from the inner sections of your site.

This is an ad-hoc solution that aims to do **one** thing, and do it right.

- Please note the following:

* The functionality of this plugin can not be limited to a given widget of the home page. Example:

You have a category "MyCategory" from which you will exclude posts from the **home page**.
A the same time, you want to display posts of "MyCategory" in a widget that is located **in the home page**.

That would be overkilling. You don't need to *exclude* everything and do one exception, you need to *allow* everything and do one exception.

* The focus of this plugin is simplicity, performance and correctness of the code.

- You can see this plugin in action the following projects where the post in home page are exclusively the ones I have written, while others 
(automatically posted via email) are present in the inner sections:

* http://asteriskfaqs.org - Important VoIP community project.
* http://slackware-es.com - Slackware Linux documentation project (Spanish)


== Installation ==

1. Upload `pecf_catfilter` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Settings' and choose which categories' posts you want to _exclude_ from the Home Page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* I'm using the plugin and while it works as expected, I would like it to allow content from a filtered category to be displayed by
some other plugin. Is that possible?

No. At least not for now. Read the description for more details.
