This plugin allows you to exclude posts that belong to certain categories from your home page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to **exclude** posts that belong to certain categories from your *home page*, while they will still be reachable
from the inner sections of your site.

Please note that you should have at least one post in certaing category in order to be able to exclude that category's posts from Home Page it using this plugin.

The focus of this plugin is simplicity, performance and correctness of the code.

present in the inner sections.
